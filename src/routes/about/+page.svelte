		I host solutions on AWS and have tooling to run on both arm64 and amd64 architectures. There are also some frontends that run in CloudFlare where we also manage DNS.
		We make use of a variety of open-source tools, many of which are uploaded to and maintained by Cantara and the team at eXOReaction. 
		Examples of tools we use include Buri for continuous updates and Nerthus for provisioning, deployment, and health/server probing. 
		We also use Visuale to display and show information.

		Our main statement is to create good, changeable, and scalable software. 
		We are committed to delivering solutions that meet the unique needs of each of our clients. 
		Thank you for considering our team for your software development needs.
